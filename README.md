#Example of Promises for my Bachelor Thesis

This application is an asynchronous file uploader, which was developed for my bachelor thesis at University of Applied Science Salzburg. It uses the FileReader API, FormData, XMLHTTPRequest and ES6 Promises.
The Backend uses the Q Promises Library: https://github.com/kriskowal/q
